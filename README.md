Visualizing Inheritance Structure in Ruby
=========================================

This code uses a simple Bash script combined with a force directed graph in D3 to visualize the inheritance structure of a Ruby project.

Put this in the main folder of the project.  Upon running the bash script create_graph.sh, it will scan the lib folder for all classes, and then create a force directed graph in a browser window using D3.
